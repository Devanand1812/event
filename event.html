<p>The game of cricket is played similar to baseball, with two teams aiming to score the most points in the form of runs. The game makes use of bats, wickets, and a field as players try to hit the ball with a bat then run for points.</p>
<h2>History of cricket</h2> <hr>
<p>The sport of cricket has a known history beginning in the late 16th century England. It became an established sport in the country in the 18th century and developed globally in the 19th and 20th centuries. International matches have been played since the 19th-century and formal Test cricket matches are considered to date from 1877. Cricket is the world's second most popular spectator sport, after association football (soccer).[1]

    Internationally, cricket is governed by <mark>the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over one hundred countries and territories in membership, although only twelve currently play Test cricket.
    
    The game's rules are defined in the "Laws of cricket"</mark>. The game has various formats, ranging from T-10(Ten-10) played in around 90 minutes to Test matches, which can last up to five days.</p>
