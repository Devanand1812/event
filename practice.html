        Hello, my name is Devanand.
        I have completed my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Hindusthan College of Engineering and Technology, graduating with a CGPA of 8.5. During my studies, I developed a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving, which inspired me to pursue a career in the IT sector.
        
        I have completed a specialized Java course from Besant Technologies, which helped me gain proficiency in Core Java. Additionally, I have knowledge of SQL, HTML, and Excel, which I believe are essential tools for a modern IT professional.
        
        I am currently seeking a full-time position as a Java Developer, Tester, or Data Analyst. I’m passionate about leveraging my technical skills while also learning and growing professionally. I’m enthusiastic about working in an environment where I can contribute to impactful projects and further develop my expertise.
        
        In my free time, I enjoy cycling, I plays cricket with my friends, which helps me stay active ,cool and focused. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself.

        <h1>Project Details</h1>
        <p>
           <b>Project Title: Anti-Face Spoofing System</b> <br>

<b>Description</b><br>
Developed a system to detect and prevent face spoofing attacks in biometric authentication systems. The project utilized image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to distinguish between genuine and fake facial inputs, such as printed photos, videos, or masks. <mark> system aimed to enhance security by analyzing facial textures, blinking patterns, and other dynamic features</mark>.<br>

<b>Technologies Used</b>: Python, OpenCV, Machine Learning Algorithms<br>

<b>Key Contributions</b><br>

Designed and implemented the feature extraction process.
Conducted testing to improve the accuracy and reliability of spoof detection.
Collaborated with a team to refine the algorithm for real-time applications.
